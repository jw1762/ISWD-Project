//REMAINING TASKS:

// 	Date in QuoteServlet does not function. 
// 	I do not know how to convert the Long into a proper Date object for java.

•	Display QuoteHistory data using the list.//The Quote object is added to the list during
											//data processing from the request form.

o	Create JSON sample data to display. We will get this data from DB in next assignment.
o	Suggestion: Supply this JSON data to the module that will display the list to UI. Later you can replace JSON data with DB data.

////////////////////////////
IMPORTANT: Submit just the code. 
Create a word/pdf doc that shows your code and sample output. 
These could be screenshots 
///////(I have one screenshot of functional site/console output).


SPECIAL NOTE FROM JCW: 
If you're using eclipse, sometimes the HTML pages don't actually update properly 
and you'll have to right click and refresh the HTML file when open in the browser.
