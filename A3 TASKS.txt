////I don't know how to do this beyond hardcoding, currently.

o	Submit this data to backend code that will validate, process this data and insert to DB in next assignment.
o	Display output in console for now showing backend is functional.

////In the servlet I create a new quoteViewer and add 
///the current quote to the list. No display from the list itself.
•	Display QuoteHistory data using the list.

////I did this with hardcodes in the java files instead.

o	Create JSON sample data to display. We will get this data from DB in next assignment.
o	Suggestion: Supply this JSON data to the module that will display the list to UI. Later you can replace JSON data with DB data.

IMPORTANT: Submit just the code. Create a word/pdf doc that shows your code and sample output. These could be screenshots.
