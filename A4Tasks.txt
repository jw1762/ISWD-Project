•	Complete the code to make database connection from your application.

//PARTIALLY done.
//Additional Functions are required in CLASS DatabaseCon to facilitate this further.
//Currently 3 functions have been implemented in order to input data into DB, and one to retrieve clientID.
//Another NON-COMPLETED function exists for retrieving entirety of quotes and/or ClientInfo.
//In order to push to UI, refer to the ClientInfo.JSP for example: the clientID is retrieved from the database once it has been inserted.
•	Retrieve data from database and display client information and quote history.


//MOSTLY done.
//Can create new clientInfo, currently will always be a new client regardless of info. 
//ClientID is returned to the client JSP for use on Request Quote page later.
//Cannot currently update information about clients from this page. Last portion of this remaining.
•	You should be able to update client information if data exists. If data doesn’t exist then create new record in database when user clicks save.
